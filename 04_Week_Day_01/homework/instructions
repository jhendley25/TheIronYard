# We are creating a tracking system for a patient as he/she goes through a hospital

- Use the Workflow gem we used today to control patient statuses.
- The patient will be transferred from the waiting room, to doctor checkup, to xrays, to surgery, to paying bills, to leaving.
- The patients should be able to jump directly from the waiting room to every status except paying bills
  - This will involve multiple events for each state!
  - I also strongly suggest making 1 route that controlls transferring between all states. If you do so, it should accept the previous and state wanted as parameters
- As the patient transfers to leaving the hospital, I want to be presented with a description field to write any details about said patient's trip through the hospital.
- Use HAML!
- Make it look nice.
  - You don't have ot go all out, but at least make it somewhat presentable.
