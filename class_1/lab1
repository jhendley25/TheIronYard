Create a guessing game! (Hangman)

- For starters, create an array of words and choose a random word (hint: research how to create random numbers)
- Create custom rules for words with certain lengths. Ie: words with 5 letters get 8 guesses.
- Display all alphebet letters
	- When the user guesses a letter, put it in the "Guessed Letters"
- User has to guess the correct word letter by letter
- If the user gets it correctly, hooray!
- If not, WOOPS
- Import the dictionary.txt file I included in the thumb drive
	- Shuffle the words
	- Choose a random word based on the length
